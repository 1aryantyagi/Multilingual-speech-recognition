# Multilingual-speech-recognition
This project is a multilingual speech recognition application that leverages OpenAI's Whisper-1 model for audio transcription, translates the transcription to English, and summarizes the translated text. Users can download a PDF containing both the transcription and summary. The application is deployed using Flask, with HTML and CSS handling the frontend.
